# Differentials

Man I hope this doesn't become deprecated lmao.

Anyway this is supposed to be some sort of outlet for symbolic differentiation, with the use of MathQuill, the same thing [Desmos](http://desmos.com) uses.

## Run

This is created using create-elm-app: make sure you have Node, elm and that installed on your computer.

Run `elm-app start` to run the development server.

- [Desmos](http://desmos.com), for being such a great graphing calculator.

- [MathQuill](http://mathquill.com/), for making it so easy manage LaTeX input and output.

- [Create Elm App](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app), with which this project is bootstrapped.

- [Dmy](https://github.com/dmy) for creating the beautiful [Elm Pratt Parser](https://github.com/dmy/elm-pratt-parser) - this project wouldn't be possible without this package.
