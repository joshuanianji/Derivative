# Differentials

Man I hope this doesn't become deprecated lmao.

Anyway this is supposed to be some sort of outlet for symbolic differentiation, with the use of MathQuill, the same thing [Desmos](http://desmos.com) uses.

## Run

This is created using create-elm-app: make sure you have Node, elm and that installed on your computer.

Run `elm-app start` to run the development server.
